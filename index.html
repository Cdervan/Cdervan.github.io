  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello,<br>I grew up in a town just outside of Orlando called Ocoee. Currently I am a sophmore at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers with hopes to succeed in a software engineering major. I have always taken an interest in computers since I was little. Everytime I got a new computer it seemed like the next chapter of my life would open up. In my sophmore year of highschool I decided to build my own desktop pc so that I could run anything and everything and avoid all the problems with my old computers. With the pc built I began realizing that computers were far to efficient to just use them as a resource. I realized that computers are the future and if I wanted any part in it, computers would be the best way for me.</p>
